## Getting Started

### 1. Install the packages

```bash
yarn install
yarn global add dotenv-cli
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

For `.env` key/value pairs, see `.env.example`.

### 3. Start the local DB Docker Compose service

```bash
./start-database.sh
```

### 4. Push the schema and seed the local DB with a "<test@example.com>" example account and test event

```bash
yarn db:push
yarn db:seed
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

- The local app should now be available at `localhost:3000` and `localhost:300/admin`!
- You can log in with "<test@example.com>"

## Data Ops

### Dev Data Studio

To manipulate the data and relations directly via Prisma during local development:

```bash
yarn db:studio
```

### Migration

To alter the data schema (adding/removing/editing columns, changing unique/compound/primary keys, etc.), make changes in `schema.prisma` file, save, and run:

```bash
yarn db:migrate
```

- Fixing failed migrations:
